## Introduction & Objective
Our data set, acquired from the Ken French Data Library, included 25 portfolios ranked upon size and book-to-market ratio. Our portfolios range across small-cap to large-cap stocks, varying from low book-to-market ratios (growth stocks) to high book-to-market ratios (value stocks) and are titled accordingly. In addition, we have the factor returns for all time periods, including RMRF (market risk premium), SMB (size factor), and HML (value factor). We will perform our analysis for all 25 of these portfolios.
